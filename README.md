Bangkit Academy: Bike Sharing Dashboard 🚴‍♂️📊

This project was developed as part of Bangkit Academy, focusing on analyzing and predicting bike rental demand using the Bike Sharing Dataset. The project combines Machine Learning with an interactive dashboard to provide insights and real-time predictions.

📌 Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify patterns and trends in bike rental demand.

Machine Learning Model: Predict bike rental demand based on weather, season, and time-related features.

Interactive Dashboard: Visualize historical data and model predictions.

User-Friendly Interface: Built for easy interpretation of data and predictions.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow

Dashboard: Streamlit / Plotly Dash

Version Control: Git & GitHub
