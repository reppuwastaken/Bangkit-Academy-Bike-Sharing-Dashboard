# Bangkit Academy: Bike Sharing Dashboard 🚴‍♂️📊  

This project was developed as part of **Bangkit Academy**, focusing on analyzing and predicting bike rental demand using the **Bike Sharing Dataset**. The project combines **Machine Learning** with an **interactive dashboard** to provide insights and real-time predictions.  

## 📌 Features  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identify patterns and trends in bike rental demand.  
- **Machine Learning Model:** Predict bike rental demand based on weather, season, and time-related features.  
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Visualize historical data and model predictions.  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built for easy interpretation of data and predictions.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow  
- **Dashboard:** Streamlit / Plotly Dash  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
